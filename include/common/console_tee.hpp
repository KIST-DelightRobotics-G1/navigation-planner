// file-descriptor level: fds 1 and 2 are pointed at a pipe and a reader thread copies the stream
// to the original tty and the file. Lines land in the file as they are written, so a run that dies
// (e-stop, closed terminal) keeps its log up to that point. Stream-level (rdbuf) mirroring would
// miss printf and the C-library / SDK output — this catches all of it.
//
// One file per run, overwritten: the latest run is what you look at. Ported from
// kist-gearsonic-inference (same infra, unchanged).
